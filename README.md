# VLAN & Router-on-a-Stick Lab (Network+ Project)

## üìå Project Overview
This lab simulates a **small enterprise network** with multiple departments segmented using VLANs.  
The main objectives were:
- Configure **VLANs** for Admin, Sales, and IT.
- Implement **Router-on-a-Stick** for inter-VLAN routing.
- Set up **DHCP services** on the router for dynamic IP allocation.
- Apply a **basic ACL** to restrict Sales from accessing Admin while allowing other traffic.

This project was built in **Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of my hands-on practice for the CompTIA **Network+ certification** and job readiness in networking/SOC environments.
